# YOLO11 Specifications

## Overview
YOLO11 is presented as the latest evolution in the YOLO family (as of the referenced benchmark study), positioned as a potentially more efficient and accurate successor to YOLOv8 and its contemporaries. [Source: [https://arxiv.org/html/2411.00201v1](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.00201v1)]

## Key Features
- **Tasks Supported:** Claimed to handle the same tasks as YOLOv8 (Object Detection, Segmentation, Pose Estimation, Oriented Object Detection - OBB) but with improved performance. [Source: [https://arxiv.org/html/2411.00201v1](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.00201v1)]
- **Performance Enhancements:** Features improved contextual understanding and architectural modules, reportedly surpassing YOLOv8 in both speed and accuracy across various applications. [Source: [https://arxiv.org/html/2411.00201v1](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.00201v1)]
- **Consistency:** The YOLO11 family is highlighted as demonstrating consistent performance across accuracy, efficiency, and model size metrics in benchmark tests, with YOLO11m noted for an optimal balance. [Source: [https://arxiv.org/html/2411.00201v1](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.00201v1)]
- **Framework:** Assumed to be supported within the Ultralytics ecosystem (PyTorch).
- **Variants:** Available in scaled versions (e.g., n, s, m, l, x). We plan to test a small variant (`YOLO11n` if available).
- **OBB Variant:** `YOLO11 OBB` exists for handling rotated objects. [Source: [https://arxiv.org/html/2411.00201v1](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.00201v1)]

## Usage in Project
- Proposed for comparative evaluation against YOLOv8 and YOLOv10 on the VDD-C dataset.
- Potential benefits include state-of-the-art accuracy and speed for diver detection.

## Known Considerations
- As the newest model mentioned in the benchmark, long-term stability and community support compared to YOLOv8 might be less established (though Ultralytics support is implied).
- Specific architectural details beyond 'improved modules' require further investigation if available in official docs.
