# Active Context: Diver Detection System

## Current Focus
We are currently in the **environment setup phase** of the diver detection project. The primary focus is on establishing the development environment, testing YOLO capabilities, and preparing for dataset collection.

## Recent Changes
1. Set up the development container with required dependencies
2. Configured Docker environment with GPU support
3. Established proper X11 forwarding for visualization tools
4. Created Memory Bank for project documentation
5. Resolved CUDA initialization issues
6. Successfully tested basic YOLO functionality

## Current Tasks
- [x] Set up Docker development environment
- [x] Configure GPU access in container
- [x] Fix X11 forwarding for visualization
- [x] Initialize project documentation
- [x] Test basic YOLO functionality
- [ ] Gather initial diver image dataset
- [ ] Create data annotation pipeline
- [ ] Develop initial model training workflow

## Next Steps

### Immediate Next Steps (Current Sprint)
1. **Improve YOLO Usage**
   - Collect sample underwater images for testing
   - Test detection on actual diver images
   - Create basic detection script for diver images

2. **Dataset Preparation**
   - Identify sources for underwater diver images
   - Define annotation requirements and format
   - Set up data preprocessing pipeline

3. **Initial Modeling Approach**
   - Select baseline YOLO version for development
   - Define model configuration for diver detection
   - Establish evaluation metrics

### Upcoming Priorities
1. **Model Training**
   - Train initial model on diver dataset
   - Evaluate performance and identify challenges
   - Iterate on model architecture and training process

2. **Jetson Deployment Testing**
   - Prepare testing environment for Jetson deployment
   - Identify optimization requirements
   - Establish benchmarking process

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Current Decision Points
1. **YOLO Version Selection**
   - YOLOv8 offers improved accuracy but may have higher resource requirements
   - YOLOv5 is more established and has better optimization tools for edge devices
   - Initial testing with YOLOv8n showing good results

2. **Dataset Approach**
   - Potential to use existing datasets vs. creating custom dataset
   - Need to determine minimum dataset size for effective training
   - Consider data augmentation strategies for underwater conditions

3. **GPU Resource Allocation**
   - Balance between development and deployment optimization
   - Consider model size limitations for Jetson platform
   - Evaluate training time vs. model complexity tradeoffs

### Known Challenges
1. **Underwater Image Characteristics**
   - Color distortion and limited visibility
   - Variable lighting conditions
   - Bubbles and particulates creating visual noise

2. **Jetson Deployment Considerations**
   - Limited GPU memory compared to development environment
   - Power and thermal constraints
   - Need for optimized inference

3. **Real-time Processing Requirements**
   - Balancing detection accuracy with processing speed
   - Managing input pipeline for consistent frame rate
   - Handling variable processing loads
