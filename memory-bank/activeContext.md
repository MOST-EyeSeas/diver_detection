# Active Context: Diver Detection System

## Current Focus
We are currently in the **dataset preparation phase** of the diver detection project. Having established the development environment and tested YOLO capabilities, we are now focusing on obtaining and preparing the VDD-C dataset for fine-tuning the YOLO model.

## Recent Changes
1. Set up the development container with required dependencies
2. Configured Docker environment with GPU support
3. Established proper X11 forwarding for visualization tools
4. Created Memory Bank for project documentation
5. Resolved CUDA initialization issues
6. Successfully tested basic YOLO functionality
7. Created download script for VDD-C dataset
8. Identified VDD-C as an excellent dataset for diver detection

## Current Tasks
- [x] Set up Docker development environment
- [x] Configure GPU access in container
- [x] Fix X11 forwarding for visualization
- [x] Initialize project documentation
- [x] Test basic YOLO functionality
- [x] Identify source for diver image dataset
- [x] Create download script for diver dataset
- [ ] Download and extract VDD-C dataset
- [ ] Create YOLO-compatible dataset structure
- [ ] Develop initial model training workflow

## Next Steps

### Immediate Next Steps (Current Sprint)
1. **Dataset Acquisition and Preparation**
   - Download VDD-C dataset (images.zip and yolo_labels.zip)
   - Extract and organize dataset into YOLO-compatible format
   - Create dataset.yaml configuration file
   - Verify dataset integrity

2. **Initial Model Testing**
   - Test YOLO model on sample diver images from dataset
   - Verify YOLO label format compatibility
   - Create basic detection script for diver images

3. **Dataset Processing Pipeline**
   - Set up data preprocessing pipeline
   - Create train/val/test splits if needed
   - Implement data visualization tools

### Upcoming Priorities
1. **Model Training**
   - Fine-tune YOLO model on VDD-C dataset
   - Evaluate performance and identify challenges
   - Iterate on model architecture and training process

2. **Jetson Deployment Testing**
   - Prepare testing environment for Jetson deployment
   - Identify optimization requirements
   - Establish benchmarking process

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Current Decision Points
1. **Dataset Selection**
   - âœ… Selected VDD-C dataset with 100,000+ annotated diver images
   - Dataset includes YOLO format labels (yolo_labels.zip)
   - Images from both pool and Caribbean environments provide good variety
   - Already annotated images save significant time vs. creating custom dataset

2. **YOLO Version Selection**
   - YOLOv8 offers improved accuracy but may have higher resource requirements
   - YOLOv5 is more established and has better optimization tools for edge devices
   - Initial testing with YOLOv8n showing good results
   - Need to evaluate which version works best with VDD-C dataset

3. **Dataset Processing Approach**
   - Determine appropriate train/val/test split ratio
   - Consider creating smaller subset for initial rapid testing
   - Plan for efficient local storage of large dataset (7.63GB images + labels)

### Known Challenges
1. **Dataset Size Considerations**
   - VDD-C dataset is large (7.63GB for images.zip)
   - Need to ensure sufficient storage space
   - Download may take significant time
   - Consider incremental download and extraction process

2. **Underwater Image Characteristics**
   - Color distortion and limited visibility
   - Variable lighting conditions
   - Bubbles and particulates creating visual noise
   - VDD-C dataset provides good representation of these challenges

3. **Jetson Deployment Considerations**
   - Limited GPU memory compared to development environment
   - Power and thermal constraints
   - Need for optimized inference

4. **Real-time Processing Requirements**
   - Balancing detection accuracy with processing speed
   - Managing input pipeline for consistent frame rate
   - Handling variable processing loads
