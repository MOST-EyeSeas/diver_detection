# Active Context: Diver Detection System

## Current Focus
We are **restarting with methodologically correct approach** after identifying a critical flaw in our original methodology. The previous 4-way comparison used validation data that models had seen during training, creating data leakage and making inference enhancement testing invalid.

**New Methodology:**
1. **Proper Dataset Split**: Create train/val/test (60/20/20) with held-out test set
2. **Clean Training**: Models never see test set during training or validation  
3. **Unbiased Testing**: Test inference enhancement on truly unseen data
4. **Real-world Validation**: Test on user's external underwater video

**Previous Results (Invalid due to Data Leakage):**
- YOLOv11n Enhanced: 0.972 mAP50 (but tested on validation data seen during training)
- YOLOv12n Original: 0.971 mAP50 (same issue)
- Enhancement benefits appeared minimal due to testing on "easy" validation data

## Next Steps

### Immediate Next Steps (Methodologically Correct Approach)
1. **Create Proper Dataset Split**
   ```bash
   python prepare_vddc_proper.py --force
   ```
   - Creates train/val/test (60/20/20) with held-out test set
   - Test set NEVER seen during training or validation
   - Reproducible split with fixed random seed

2. **Create Enhanced Version**
   ```bash
   python enhance_dataset_proper.py --force
   ```
   - Enhance images while maintaining proper split structure
   - Parallel processing for efficiency
   - Maintains same train/val/test boundaries

3. **Retrain Models (Clean 4-Way Comparison)**
   - YOLOv11n + Original Proper Dataset
   - YOLOv11n + Enhanced Proper Dataset
   - YOLOv12n + Original Proper Dataset
   - YOLOv12n + Enhanced Proper Dataset
   - Use only train+val for training, hold out test completely

4. **Unbiased Inference Enhancement Testing**
   - Test on held-out test set (never seen during training)
   - Compare original vs enhanced preprocessing during inference
   - This should show definitive enhancement advantages
