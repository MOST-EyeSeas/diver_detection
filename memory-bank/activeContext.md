   - ‚úÖ Selected YOLOv11n Original for production deployment
   - ‚úÖ Confirmed excellent performance: 97.8% mAP50, 72.0% mAP50-95
   - ‚úÖ Enhancement benefits minimal for nano models (+0.2% mAP50-95)

2. **Transect Line Detection (COMPLETED)**
   - ‚úÖ Outstanding baseline performance: 94.9% mAP50, 94.3% precision, 90.3% recall
   - ‚úÖ Methodology perfectly generalized from diver detection
   - ‚úÖ Fast training (6.4 minutes) and efficient model (5.4MB)

3. **Enhancement Strategy (CRITICAL FINDINGS DISCOVERED)**
   - ‚úÖ **Task-Specific Enhancement Effects Confirmed**: Enhancement helps divers (+0.2%), hurts transect lines (-11%)
   - ‚úÖ **Over-Processing Identified**: Aggressive parameters cause oversaturation/artifacts in geometric patterns
   - ‚úÖ **Production Decision**: Use original models for both tasks - enhancement is NOT universal

4. **Training Infrastructure (PROVEN)**
   - ‚úÖ Robust 60-20-20 split methodology prevents data leakage
   - ‚úÖ 50-epoch training optimal for avoiding overfitting
   - ‚úÖ Methodology successfully applied across multiple detection tasks

### Key Findings for Future Reference
1. **Methodology Generalization Confirmed**
   - Diver Detection: 97.8% mAP50 (nano model capacity near ceiling)
   - Transect Line Detection: 94.9% mAP50 (excellent performance, different visual patterns)
   - Same training approach, dataset preparation, and evaluation methodology

2. **Detection Task Differences**
   - Divers: Complex human shapes, multiple poses, occlusion challenges
   - Transect Lines: Linear patterns, geometric shapes, consistent visual features
   - Both benefit from underwater-specific processing approach

3. **GPU Memory Patterns**
   - Training: ~2.3GB (model + gradients + optimizer + batch data + activations)
   - Inference: ~50-100MB (model + single image forward pass only)
   - 40x memory reduction from training to deployment

4. **Cross-Task Enhancement Analysis (CRITICAL DISCOVERY)**
   - **Diver Detection**: Enhancement provides minimal benefit (+0.2% mAP50-95)
   - **Transect Line Detection**: Enhancement significantly hurts performance (-11% mAP50-95)
   - **Root Cause**: Over-processing (oversaturation, artifacts) disrupts geometric pattern recognition
   - **Production Impact**: Enhancement is task-dependent, not universally beneficial
