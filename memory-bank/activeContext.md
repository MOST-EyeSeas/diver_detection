# Active Context: Diver Detection System

## Current Focus
**‚úÖ DIVER DETECTION PHASE COMPLETED**: Successfully demonstrated that enhancement benefits exist but are minimal for nano-scale models using methodologically sound 50-epoch training with proper 60-20-20 splits.

**FINAL 50-EPOCH RESULTS (Production-Ready):**
1. ‚úÖ **Proper Dataset Split**: 60/20/20 train/val/test with completely held-out test set (2,303 images)
2. ‚úÖ **Clean Training**: Models never see test set during training or validation  
3. ‚úÖ **Optimal Epoch Count**: 50 epochs avoids overfitting while achieving excellent performance
4. ‚úÖ **Unbiased Testing**: Demonstrated results on truly unseen data
5. ‚úÖ **Production Decision**: YOLOv11n Original selected for deployment

**FINAL PRODUCTION RESULTS (50 epochs, held-out test set):**
- **YOLOv11n Original**: mAP50-95=72.0%, mAP50=97.8% (SELECTED FOR DEPLOYMENT)
- **YOLOv11n Enhanced**: mAP50-95=72.2%, mAP50=97.6% (+0.2% enhancement benefit)
- **Enhancement Impact**: Minimal but measurable improvement (+0.2% mAP50-95)
- **Decision**: Enhancement overhead not justified for nano model capacity
- **Model Size**: 5.4MB, suitable for Jetson deployment
- **Performance**: 97.8% mAP50 excellent for production underwater diver detection

**NEXT PHASE PLANNED**: Transect Line Detection with potential enhancement testing using same proven methodology.
