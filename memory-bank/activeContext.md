## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Current Decision Points
1. **Dataset Selection**
   - ✅ Selected VDD-C dataset with 100,000+ annotated diver images
   - ✅ Successfully processed 105,552 images (84,441 training, 21,111 validation)
   - ✅ Matched labels for 83,858 training and 20,972 validation images
   - ✅ Final processed dataset contains 5,997 training and 5,763 validation images

2. **YOLO Version Selection**
   - YOLOv8 offers improved accuracy but may have higher resource requirements
   - YOLOv5 is more established and has better optimization tools for edge devices
   - Initial testing with YOLOv8n showing good results
   - Need to evaluate which version works best with VDD-C dataset

3. **Training Approach**
   - Start with pre-trained weights vs training from scratch
   - Single-class (diver) vs multi-class approach
   - Appropriate training epochs and learning rate schedule
   - Batch size optimization for available GPU memory

### Known Challenges
1. **Underwater Image Characteristics**
   - Color distortion and limited visibility
   - Variable lighting conditions
   - Bubbles and particulates creating visual noise
   - VDD-C dataset provides good representation of these challenges

2. **Class Imbalance**
   - Some underwater scenes may have multiple divers while others have single divers
   - Need to ensure balanced loss function and evaluation metrics
   - Consider specialized detection approaches for small/distant divers

3. **Jetson Deployment Considerations**
   - Limited GPU memory compared to development environment
   - Power and thermal constraints
   - Need for optimized inference
   - Balance between accuracy and performance

4. **Real-time Processing Requirements**
   - Balancing detection accuracy with processing speed
   - Managing input pipeline for consistent frame rate
   - Handling variable processing loads
