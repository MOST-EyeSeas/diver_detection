# Project Brief: Diver Detection System

## Overview
This project aims to develop a real-time diver detection system using YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection framework. The system will identify and track divers in underwater environments through video feeds or image analysis.

## Core Requirements

1. **Detection Capabilities**
   - Accurately detect divers in underwater environments
   - Work in varied visibility conditions and water turbidity
   - Distinguish divers from other marine objects/life

2. **Performance Requirements**
   - Real-time detection on NVIDIA Jetson platform
   - Optimize for resource-constrained environments
   - Minimize false positives/negatives

3. **System Integration**
   - Process video streams from underwater cameras
   - Support standard video formats and inputs
   - Provide clear visual and/or data output of detections

4. **Deployment Specifications**
   - Development on Ubuntu x86 with GPU acceleration
   - Final deployment on NVIDIA Jetson platform
   - Containerized solution for easy deployment

## Success Criteria

1. Detection accuracy above 85% in varied underwater conditions
2. Real-time processing capability (minimum 10 FPS on Jetson)
3. Successful detection in different lighting conditions
4. Easy deployment process to target hardware

## Project Scope Boundaries

### In Scope
- YOLO model training and optimization for diver detection
- Development of detection pipeline
- Performance optimization for Jetson deployment

- Basic visualization tools

### Out of Scope
- Multi-object tracking beyond divers
- Custom hardware development
- Cloud-based processing
- Integration with specific underwater vehicle systems (unless specified later)

## Timeline and Milestones
To be determined based on project requirements and team capacity.
