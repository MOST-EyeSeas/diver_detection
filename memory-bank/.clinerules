# Cline's Project Intelligence for Diver Detection System

## Project Patterns

### Docker Environment Preferences
- Always use `--gpus all` and `--ipc=host` flags for Docker runs to ensure proper GPU access
- X11 forwarding requires proper configuration for visualization to work:
  - Set `DISPLAY` environment variable
  - Mount `/tmp/.X11-unix` directory
  - Mount `.Xauthority` file
  - Set `QT_X11_NO_MITSHM=1` to avoid shared memory issues

### YOLO-specific Patterns
- Use `yolo predict model=yolo11n.pt show=True` to test basic inference with visualization
- For non-GUI operation, use `show=False` to disable visualization
- Model files use `.pt` extension and are typically kept in the project root
- Models are gitignored (not stored in version control)

### Workflow Patterns
- Development happens on Ubuntu x86 with GPU
- Final deployment target is NVIDIA Jetson
- Use VS Code with devcontainers for consistent development environment
- SSH/Git operations require correct permissions (600) on key files

### File Organization
- Docker configuration in `Dockerfile` and `.devcontainer/`
- Model files in project root (`.pt` extension)
- Memory bank documentation in `memory-bank/`
- Use relative paths in code to maintain portability

## Critical Implementation Paths

### GPU Access
- NVIDIA GPU must be properly accessible from the container
- Use `nvidia-smi` to verify GPU visibility
- CUDA initialization errors often relate to missing GPU access or driver mismatch

### X11 Display
- Use `DISPLAY` environment variable to forward X11 display
- GTK dependencies are required for proper OpenCV GUI support
- Test with `yolo predict model=yolo11n.pt show=True` to verify visualization works

### SSH Configuration
- SSH files require specific permissions (directory: 700, key files: 600)
- When mounting from host, use separate directory with correct permissions
- Configure Git to use specific SSH command with proper key path

## Known Challenges

### OpenCV GTK Support
- Symptoms: "Environment does not support cv2.imshow()" or "Rebuild with GTK+"
- Solution: Install GTK development libraries in container
- Required packages: libgtk2.0-dev, libgtk-3-dev, and related dependencies

### CUDA Initialization
- Symptoms: "CUDA unknown error" or initialization failure
- Solutions:
  - Use `--gpus all` flag for Docker
  - Set `NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=all` environment variable
  - Ensure host drivers are compatible

### SSH Permission Issues
- Symptoms: "Bad owner or permissions" errors
- Solution: Create dedicated .ssh directory with proper permissions instead of mounting

## Project-Specific Intelligence

### Model Selection
- YOLOv8n is a good starting point for testing (~6.3 MB size)
- For Jetson deployment, models should be optimized for edge inference
- Consider nano or small variants for resource-constrained environments

### Performance Expectations
- Development GPU (RTX 3070): ~60+ FPS inference expected
- Jetson target: 10-30 FPS depending on model size and optimization

### Underwater Conditions
- Underwater imagery presents special challenges:
  - Color distortion (blue/green dominant)
  - Light scattering effects
  - Particulates and bubbles
  - Variable visibility ranges
- Dataset augmentation should account for these conditions
