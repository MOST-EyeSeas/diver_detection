## What Works

### Development Environment
- Docker container with NVIDIA GPU support is operational
- YOLO framework is installed and available
- OpenCV is configured with GTK support for visualization
- X11 forwarding is working for GUI applications
- Git/SSH integration is configured correctly

### Testing Capabilities
- Basic YOLO inference using pre-trained models is possible
- Can run `yolo predict model=yolo11n.pt show=True` to test detection
- NVIDIA GPU is properly detected and accessible from the container
- Terminal access and development tools are working as expected

## What's Left to Build

### High Priority (Next Sprint)
1. **Dataset Collection and Preparation**
   - Gather underwater diver images
   - Create annotation system/workflow
   - Implement data preprocessing pipeline

2. **Initial Model Training**
   - Configure YOLO for diver detection
   - Run initial training with small dataset
   - Evaluate baseline performance

3. **Testing Framework**
   - Create evaluation metrics for model assessment
   - Set up automated testing pipeline
   - Document performance benchmarks

### Medium Priority
1. **Model Optimization**
   - Tune hyperparameters for improved performance
   - Implement data augmentation for underwater conditions
   - Explore model pruning for efficiency

2. **Pipeline Development**
   - Develop preprocessing for underwater imagery
   - Create post-processing for detection results
   - Build visualization tools for analysis

### Low Priority (Future Work)
1. **Jetson Deployment**
   - Set up Jetson testing environment
   - Optimize model for Jetson hardware
   - Configure deployment pipeline

2. **Advanced Features**
   - Multiple diver tracking
   - Diver activity recognition
   - Integration with other underwater systems

## Known Issues

| Issue | Severity | Status | Description |
|-------|----------|--------|-------------|
| OpenCV GUI Support | Medium | âœ… Resolved | Fixed by installing GTK dependencies |
| CUDA Initialization | Medium | âœ… Resolved | Fixed GPU passthrough configuration |
| SSH Permission Issues | Low | âœ… Resolved | Implemented custom SSH directory with correct permissions |
| X11 Authorization | Low | âœ… Resolved | Added proper mount points and environment variables |

## Notes and Observations

- The ultralytics/ultralytics:latest Docker image provides a good starting point with YOLO pre-installed
- GPU acceleration is working correctly with proper container configuration
- Current setup should be sufficient for model development and testing
- Need to collect underwater imagery data, which may be challenging to source
- May need to consider data augmentation techniques specific to underwater environments
