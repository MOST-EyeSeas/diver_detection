## What Works

### Development Environment
- Docker container with NVIDIA GPU support is operational
- YOLO framework is installed and available
- OpenCV is configured with GTK support for visualization
- X11 forwarding is working for GUI applications
- Git/SSH integration is configured correctly
- CUDA initialization issues resolved, GPU acceleration working

### Data Acquisition
- Identified VDD-C dataset as ideal source for diver detection training
  - 100,000+ annotated images of divers underwater
  - Includes images from both pool and Caribbean environments
  - Already provides YOLO format labels (yolo_labels.zip)
  - Available under Creative Commons license
- Created download_vddc.py script with advanced features:
  - Selective component download (images, labels, etc.)
  - Progress tracking with tqdm
  - Download resume capability for large files
  - Automatic retry for failed downloads
  - MD5 verification support
  - Command-line interface with flexible options
- Successfully downloaded the complete dataset:
  - images.zip (8.38GB) - Main image files
  - yolo_labels.zip (6.06MB) - YOLO format labels

### Dataset Preparation
- Created prepare_vddc.py script with the following capabilities:
  - Verifies downloaded files before extraction
  - Creates proper YOLO dataset directory structure
  - Extracts ZIP files with progress tracking
  - Splits dataset into train/val sets (80/20 by default)
  - Creates dataset.yaml configuration file for YOLO
  - Verifies YOLO compatibility of the prepared dataset
  - Includes cleanup of temporary extraction directories
  - Provides command-line options for customization
- Successfully prepared the dataset:
  - Processed 105,552 total images (84,441 training, 21,111 validation)
  - Matched labels for 83,858 training and 20,972 validation images
  - Final dataset contains 5,997 training and 5,763 validation images
  - All training and validation images have corresponding labels
  - Generated dataset.yaml with proper configuration

### Testing Capabilities
- Basic YOLO inference using pre-trained models is functional
- Successfully ran `yolo predict model=yolo11n.pt show=True` to test detection (after manual download)
- NVIDIA GPU is properly detected and accessible from the container
- Terminal access and development tools are working as expected
- Sample detection working on default images (bus.jpg, zidane.jpg)

## What's Left to Build

### High Priority (Current Sprint)
1. **Monitor Training Runs**
   - Track YOLOv11n and YOLOv12n training progress.

2. **Evaluate & Compare Models**
   - Once training finishes, collect and analyze performance metrics.
   - Document results in a comparison table.
   - Select the best model.

3. **Document Decision**
   - Update Memory Bank with results and selection.

### Medium Priority
1. **Pipeline Development & Optimization**
   - If necessary, further optimize the chosen model.
   - Develop full processing pipeline (preprocessing, postprocessing).

2. **Documentation and Examples**
   - Document the training process and results
   - Create instructions for model usage
   - Develop examples of inference with the trained model
   - Prepare comprehensive documentation

### Low Priority (Future Work)
1. **Jetson Deployment**
   - Set up Jetson testing environment
   - Optimize model for Jetson hardware
   - Configure deployment pipeline
   - Benchmark performance on target hardware

2. **Advanced Features**
   - Multiple diver tracking
   - Diver activity recognition
   - Integration with other underwater systems
   - Custom detection UI for operators

## Known Issues

| Issue | Severity | Status | Description |
|-------|----------|--------|-------------|
| OpenCV GUI Support | Medium | ‚úÖ Resolved | Fixed by installing GTK dependencies |
| CUDA Initialization | Medium | ‚úÖ Resolved | Fixed GPU passthrough configuration |
| SSH Permission Issues | Low | ‚úÖ Resolved | Implemented custom SSH directory with correct permissions |
| X11 Authorization | Low | ‚úÖ Resolved | Added proper mount points and environment variables |
| Dataset Size | Medium | ‚úÖ Resolved | Successfully downloaded (8.38GB) and processed with prepare_vddc.py |
| Label Matching | Medium | ‚úÖ Resolved | Fixed path construction in prepare_vddc.py |
| Model Weight Auto-Download | Low | ‚úÖ Resolved (Workaround) | Newer models (v11, v12) required manual download via `wget`. Documented in `.clinerules`. |

## Notes and Observations

- The ultralytics/ultralytics:latest Docker image provides a good starting point with YOLO pre-installed
- GPU acceleration is working correctly with proper container configuration
- Initial YOLO testing shows successful object detection on sample images
- YOLOv8n model (~6.5 GFLOPs) provides good balance of performance and accuracy
- VDD-C dataset provides excellent training data for underwater diver detection:
  - Much larger than typical custom datasets (100,000+ images)
  - Already annotated, saving significant time
  - Includes challenging underwater conditions (visibility, lighting, etc.)
  - Suitable for YOLO training with provided YOLO format labels
- The download_vddc.py script handles large file downloads well with resume capability
- The prepare_vddc.py script correctly creates a proper YOLO dataset structure with train/val splits
- Label files in the VDD-C dataset are organized by:
  - Directory structure: yolo/train, yolo/val, yolo/test
  - Naming convention: [directory]_[image_name].txt
- Training runs initiated for `yolov11n` and `yolov12n` (50 epochs).
