# Product Context: Diver Detection System

## Problem Statement
Underwater environments present unique challenges for human operators and automated systems. The detection and tracking of divers in these environments is particularly challenging due to:

1. **Variable Visibility**: Underwater visibility can change drastically based on water conditions
2. **Lighting Variations**: Light refracts differently underwater, creating challenging recognition scenarios
3. **Safety Risks**: Manual monitoring of divers is prone to human error and fatigue
4. **Resource Limitations**: Underwater systems often have constrained computational resources

Without reliable automated diver detection:
- Safety risks increase for divers working in hazardous conditions
- Monitoring underwater operations becomes labor-intensive
- Recording and tracking diver movements for analysis is challenging
- Coordination between surface teams and divers is complicated

## Solution Overview
Our Diver Detection System uses YOLO-based computer vision to:

1. **Enhance Safety**: Automatically track divers to ensure they remain in safe operational areas
2. **Improve Monitoring**: Provide real-time awareness of diver positions
3. **Enable Analysis**: Record diver movements for post-operation analysis
4. **Operate in Resource-Constrained Environments**: Run efficiently on Jetson hardware

## User Personas

### Diving Operations Supervisor
- **Role**: Oversees diving operations and ensures safety
- **Needs**: Real-time awareness of all diver positions, automated alerts for unsafe conditions
- **Pain Points**: Currently relies on manual observation which is error-prone

### Underwater Robotics Engineer
- **Role**: Integrates detection systems with underwater vehicles/equipment
- **Needs**: Lightweight detection system that can run on embedded hardware
- **Pain Points**: Most detection systems require powerful hardware unavailable in underwater contexts

### Marine Research Scientist
- **Role**: Studies diver behavior and underwater operations
- **Needs**: Accurate tracking of diver movements for analysis
- **Pain Points**: Manual annotation of diver positions in video feeds is time-consuming

## User Experience Goals

1. **Reliability**: The system should work consistently across various underwater conditions
2. **Simplicity**: Integration with existing systems should be straightforward
3. **Clarity**: Detection outputs should be clear and easily interpretable
4. **Responsiveness**: Real-time detection with minimal latency
5. **Configurability**: Adjustable parameters to optimize for specific underwater conditions

## Key Benefits

1. **Enhanced Safety**: Automated monitoring reduces the risk of lost or endangered divers
2. **Operational Efficiency**: Reduced need for manual monitoring frees personnel for other tasks
3. **Data-Driven Insights**: Collected data enables analysis to improve diving operations
4. **Resource Optimization**: Operates effectively even on limited computing hardware
5. **Improved Decision Making**: Real-time awareness enables better operational decisions
